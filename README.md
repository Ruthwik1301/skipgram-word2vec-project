# skipgram-word2vec-project
This project implements the Skip-gram model with Negative Sampling to learn word embeddings from Wikipedia data.

Due to system limitations, the final training and evaluation were done using Google Colab.

The project includes:
- Implementation code
- Comparison with Gensim Word2Vec
- Word analogy test
- Bias detection in embeddings
